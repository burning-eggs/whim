# whim
 Stack based programming language inspired by Forth.
 
 **QUICK DISCLAIMER: COMPILING .whm FILES CURRENTLY DOESNT WORK ON WINDOWS.** 

 Whim is planned to be
 - [x] Compiled
 - [x] Native
 - [x] Stack-Based (just like Forth)
 - [ ] Turing-Complete (yes, the development is at such an early stage that this thing is not even Turing-Complete yet)
 - [ ] Statically Typed
 - [ ] Self-Hosted (Python is used only as an initial bootstrap. Once the language is mature enough we will rewrite it in itself.)

## Quick Start

```console
$ ./whim.py sim examples/test.whm
$ ./whim.py com examples/test.whm
$ ./test.asm
```
