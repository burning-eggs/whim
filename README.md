# whim

 Stack based programming language inspired by Forth.
 
 **QUICK DISCLAIMER: COMPILING .whm FILES CURRENTLY DOESNT WORK ON WINDOWS.** 

 Whim is planned to be
 - [x] Compiled
 - [x] Native
 - [x] Stack-Based
 - [ ] Turing-Complete
 - [ ] Statically Typed
 - [ ] Self-Hosted

## Example

 Simple program that prints numbers from 10 to 1 in descending order:

 ```whim
 10 while dup 0 > do
     dup .
    1 -
 end
 ```

## Quick Start

### Simulation

 Simulating a `.whm` simply interprets the program.

 ```console
 $ cat program.whm
 50 50 + .
 $ ./whim.py sim program.whm
 100
 ```

### Compiling

 Compiling a `.whm` file generates assembly code and compiles it with [nasm](https://www.nasm.us), and then links it with [GNU ld](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/). Make sure you have both available in your `$PATH`.

 ```console
 $ cat program.whm
 30 30 + .
 $ ./whim.py com program.whm
 [COMPILE] Generating 'program.asm'
 [CMD] nasm -felf64 program.asm
 [CMD] ld -o program.asm program.o
 [CMD] rm -rf program.o
 $ ./program.asm
 60
 ```

## Language Reference

 This is what the language supports so far. **Since the language is a work in progress, the exact set of operations is subject to change.**

### Stack Manipulation

 - `<integer>` - push an integer onto the stack. Right now the integer is anything that can be parsed by the [int](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int) function.

 - `dup` - duplicate an element on top of the stack.

 - `.` - print the element on top of the stack and remove it from the stack.

### Comparison

 - `=` - checks if two elements on top of the stack are equal. Removes the element from the stack and pushes `1` if they are equal, `0` if not.

 - `>` - checks if the element below the top element is greater than the top element.
